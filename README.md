# Text-Plotter
This project is my first coding project i created for work. It is used to convert a csv file that was generated by a pressure transducer measuring pressure over an extended period of time. This file converts it into a graph via Python. 
The amount of data points collecte for each file varied so i limited it to 8900 which was a minimum value that all the files had. I set the index counter to start at 5 because the csv file relevant pressure data started at line 5, the data before that was some generic record keeping, title information output by the program. 
Look at your data to see which line the relevant data begins in the CSV file.
